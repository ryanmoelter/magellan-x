# Magellan X

A simple, flexible, and practical navigation framework for Android using Jetpack Compose.

## Why would I use Magellan?

- **Simple**: Intuitive abstractions and encapsulation make it easy to reason through code.
- **Flexible**: The infinitely-nestable structure allows for many different styles of structuring an
  app and navigating between pages.
- **Practical**: We pay special attention to simplifying common patterns and removing day-to-day
  boilerplate.
- **Testable**: Plain objects that are easy to instantiate and control make testing simple.

## Download

Add jitpack to your `repositories` (in your root `build.gradle.kts` file):

```kotlin
allprojects {
  repositories {
    // ...
    maven("https://jitpack.io")
  }
}
```

### Add to Gradle version catalog

To use in [gradle's version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html),
add the following to your `libs.versions.toml`:

[![Latest release on Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/v/com.ryanmoelter/magellanx.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#com.ryanmoelter/magellanx)

```toml
[versions]
magellanx = "0.5.2"
# ...

[libraries]
magellanx-compose = { module = "com.ryanmoelter.magellanx:magellanx-compose", version.ref = "magellanx" }
magellanx-test = { module = "com.ryanmoelter.magellanx:magellanx-test", version.ref = "magellanx" }
```

Alternatively, if you only want the core library without the Compose implementation, you can use:

```toml
magellanx-core = { module = "com.ryanmoelter.magellanx:magellanx-core", version.ref = "magellanx" }
```

> Note: `magellanx-core` is included in and exposed by `magellanx-compose`, and `magellan-test` only
> applies to `magellanx-compose`.

And don't forget to use them in your `dependencies` block:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation(libs.magellan.compose)
  testImplementation(libs.magellan.test)
  // Alternatively:
  // implementation(libs.magellan.core)

  // ...
}
```

### Add to `dependencies` block

<details>
  <summary>Add to <code>dependencies</code> block instead</summary>

If you don't want to use version catalogs, you can add the dependencies you need directly in your
`dependencies` block:

[![Latest release on Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/v/com.ryanmoelter/magellanx.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#com.ryanmoelter/magellanx)

```kotlin
val magellanxVersion = "0.5.2"
implementation("com.ryanmoelter.magellanx:magellanx-compose:${magellanxVersion}")
testImplementation("com.ryanmoelter.magellanx:magellanx-test:${magellanxVersion}")
```

Alternatively, if you only want the core library without the Compose implementation, you can use:

```kotlin
implementation("com.github.ryanmoelter.magellanx:magellanx-core:0.5.2")
```

> Note: `magellanx-core` is included in and exposed by `magellanx-compose`, and `magellan-test` only
> applies to `magellanx-compose`.

### Dependency versions

<details>
  <summary>Dependencies' versions for different Magellan X versions</summary>

Magellan X uses the following dependencies, and since `0.2.0` is using
[the compose bill of materials (BOM)](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup#using-the-bom).

## Quickstart

To start, create a `RootStep` that just says "Hello world":

```kotlin
class RootStep : ComposeStep() {
  @Composable
  override fun Content() {
    Text("Hello world!")
  }
}
```

Then attach it in your `MainActivity`:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
  private val rootStep = /* Get singleton from dependency injection */

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    // ...
    setContentNavigable(rootStep)  // Add rootStep to the lifecycle and UI
    // ...
  }
}
```

And run the app! You should see your "Hello world!" message.

If you want to navigate, make the `RootStep` a `Journey` and create a child step:

```kotlin
class RootStep : ComposeJourney() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    // Navigating in onCreate (before the UI is shown) sets the initial `Step` with no transition
    navigator.goTo(
      ChildStep(
        goToNext = { navigator.goTo(MessageStep("Hello Magellan!")) }
      )
    )
  }

  // No need to override Content() in a Journey, unless you want to add decoration around the child Steps
}

class ChildStep(
  // Navigation is passed into child Steps as parameters
  // Steps don't do their own navigation, instead they delegate to their parent Journey
  val goToNext: () -> Unit
) : ComposeStep() {
  @Composable
  override fun Content() {
    Button(onClick = { goToNext() }) {
      Text("Go to next page")
    }
  }
}

class SecondChildStep(
  // Step parameters are typesafe
  val message: String
): ComposeStep() {
  @Composable
  override fun Content() {
    Text("Navigation is fun!")
  }
}
```

And congrats, you've now created your first two pages! ðŸ¥³

These are simple concepts, but they're powerful layers of abstraction. Some more advanced patterns include:

- `Journey`s are `Step`s, meaning you can nest `Journey`s inside other `Journey`s to encapsulate your navigation.
- You can nest a `Step` inside another `Step` using `val nestedChild by attachFieldToLifecycle(MyStep())`, and it will receive all lifecycle events. This is especially useful to break up complex pages into smaller, more maintainable parts.
- If you want to reuse a piece of lifecycle-aware logic, make an object that implements the `LifecycleAware` interface, and attach it with `attachFieldToLifecycle` just like a step.
- In addition to the usual Android lifecycle events (which work as expected), Magellan also has `Shown` (`onShow()`/`onHide()`), which is like `Started` but not called when the activity is simply recreated (e.g. on rotation or another configuration change).

Eventually, I'll get around to adding a proper wiki, but feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/ryanmoelter/magellanx/issues) or [a discussion](https://github.com/ryanmoelter/magellanx/discussions) if you have any questions!
